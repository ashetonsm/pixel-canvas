# pixel-canvas

An app meant to create and export simple pixel art drawings on a 32 x 32 pixel canvas.


This app was inspired by a tutorial by [0shuvo0](https://github.com/0shuvo0/pilex-art). However, pixel-canvas was built to run in Vue and be used in a larger application.

### To do:
- [ ] Add export to .png functionality
    - [ ] Mock sending exported .png to AWS S3
- [ ] Add extra color changing functionality that is toggled on or off depending on user privilege.
- [ ] Add tests
