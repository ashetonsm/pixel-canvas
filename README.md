# pixel-canvas

An app meant to create and export simple pixel art drawings on a 24 x 24 pixel canvas.


This app was inspired by a tutorial by [0shuvo0](https://github.com/0shuvo0/pilex-art). 


Pixel-canvas was built to run in Vue and be used as a small part of a larger application. That application is NeatNest, which can be found here: [NeatNest](https://github.com/ashetonsm/neatnest)

### To do:
- [x] Add tests (90% coverage)
- [ ] Toggle colors on and off
- [x] Add export to .png functionality
    - [x] Locally display images on the page and make them available for viewing/download on click
    - [ ] Persist images on refresh by using localStorage or other methods
